# Multiphysics Simulation Project

## Overview

This project provides tools and examples for simulating coupled physical phenomena—such as mechanics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetics—using computational methods. The goal is to accurately model real-world systems where multiple physical processes interact.

## Features

- **Coupled Physics Simulations:** Model interactions between different physical domains (e.g., fluid-structure, thermo-mechanical).
- **Numerical Methods:** Utilize finite element, finite difference, or finite volume methods for solving coupled partial differential equations.
- **Visualization:** Output and visualize simulation results for analysis.
- **Extensible:** Designed for easy integration with additional physics modules or custom solvers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** (for custom scripts)
- **Multiphysics Simulation Software** (OpenFOAM)
- **Dependencies:** (NumPy, Matplotlib)

### Installation
